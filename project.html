          <p>This projected consisited of the use of javascript in order to create a photo gallery of my favorite band. The way it works is that by posting the image link into the input bar the image will pop up and align with the previous images like a gallery. I learned how to control the input using javascript and how too properly align those images. </p>

           <p>In this project, my group and I focused on the opression that palestinians endure constantly and we created an app named Olive to spread awarness. The applications we used were fimgma to create the actual app and canva to create the presentation displaying the information. It was a struggle finding the information regardging the topic as we wanted to make sure it accurate and precise to the situation but if we had more time we could actually code the app and add more features.   </p>

            <p>This project consisted of using javascript to make a character quiz. I used my favorite member of a band to create a simple working quiz that would result in the user recieving different versions of the member throughout different albums. The javascript used in this project were if else statements and it was a refresher too use them as  I haven't used them in a while. </p>

          <p>This project was a hire me profile that had me make a profile for my partner. I used HTML and CSS to code the website and put some information of my partner such as their skill set and even prior work experience. This project was mainly similar to a resume and was valuable in collaborating with a partner.</p>

          <p>This project is a storyboard, where the topic I chose was Minecraft. The storyline was very thorough and it used javascript to mainly code it. Different functions such as clicking and hovering over images would lead to the next event in the storyline but there was also a option too choose a different way to approach the story. Overall, it was educational too learn more about javascript and how it can really impact the feeling of a website. </p>
